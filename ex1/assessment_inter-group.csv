How could the submission be improved? Please state your points clearly, concisely, and actionable:

*If we have more information about the details of how the report has to look like we can orient ourselves better on it. For now it was a lot of guess work if we have to include code into the report (since it is already submitted with the zip file -> duplication). Same for diagrams, since they are provided through the code. But all of this will clear up with future submissions.
